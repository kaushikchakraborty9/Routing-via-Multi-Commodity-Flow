# Routing-via-Multi-Commodity-Flow
We explore the problem of routing in a quantum internet using multi-commodity flow. In this project, we assume that all of the repeaters are based on atomic ensemble and linear optics. Moreover, we assume that any node in the network can act as an end node as well as a repeater node.
